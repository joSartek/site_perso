# Biography

My name is Jonathan Sarton and I am an associate professor at Université de Strasbourg in France.
I obtained my PhD in high performance visualization in 2018 at Université de Reims (France). The research I conducted during my PhD thesis focused on interactive visualization of very large volume datasets. In this context I proposed a GPU-based ray-guided approch combined with an out-of-core method for direct volume rendering on multi-GPU environnement.
